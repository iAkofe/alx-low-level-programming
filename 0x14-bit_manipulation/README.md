**BIT MANIPULATION**

Bit (0 and 1) can be manipulated directly using some bit manipulation operators. just like the logical operators, the bit operators compare one or more operands and returns a new value.

However, unlike logical operators, the Bit operators manipulate or check operands based on their binary value and not their decimal value.

**SOME BIT MANIPULATOR OPERATORS**
| bitwise OR
& bitwise AND
^ bitwise XOR
<< bit shift left
>> bit shift right
~ bitwise NOT

In this directory, there are many .c files which contain codes the implement the different bit manipulation concepts in C.

C programming is fun!!
