# DOUBLY LINKED LISTS

## Introduction
A Doubly linked list (DLL), just like a singly linked liat, has a pointer to the next node and the node data but, unlike the singly linked list, the DLL has a pointer to the previous node in the list.

## Advantages of DLL

1. Can be traversed both forward and backward
2. The delete operation is more efficient if the pointer to the node to be deleted is given
3. Allows for quick insertion of a node before a given node

## Disadvantages of DLL

1. Extra space is needed for the previous pointer
All operations requires the previous pointer to be maintained

## Inserting nodes in a DLL
Nodes can be inserted in three ways in a DLL
1. At the front of the list
2. After a given node
3. At the end of the list
4. Before a given node
